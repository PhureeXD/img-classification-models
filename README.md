# img-classification-models

This repository contains implementations of various image classification models using TensorFlow and Keras. The models included are:

1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A simple feedforward neural network with dense layers.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A more advanced model that uses convolutional layers to capture spatial features.
3. **Transfer Learning with VGG16**: A model that leverages the pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction and fine-tuning.

Each model is trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
